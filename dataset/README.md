## Download your copy of dataset

If you wish to use the same dataset as done here, you can download it directly from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k).

Follow these steps to get your dataset ready:

* Run `python3 dataset/unzip.py`
* Now you may delete the `.zip` file, downloaded earlier (be careful what you delete)
